            <h2>Introduction</h2> 
            <p>Hello!
            <br>
            Here you may find three proposals for visualizing the data collected thus far in my term project. All sketches are preliminary and do not currently accurately reflect data collected over the last few weeks.</p>

            <h2>Sketch 1</h2> 
            <p>This sketch is a standard bubble plot, and will likely be the final visualization used in my term project. 
            <br>
            All sketches explore the same basic hypothesis: as the amount of time I spend browsing the web increases, the number of words I write per day decreases (as measured using word counts in word processors, online word-counter websites, etc.). In addition, each sketch represents at least one additional variable that may affect the data. In the case of this sketch, time spent on classwork and time spent offline are also represented.
            <br>
            Words written per day are denominated exactly in numbers, with no additional visual conversions needed. All other dimensions of data are denoted in hours, with minuted expressed as a decimal percentage (e.g. 12 hours and 30 minutes would be "12.5 hrs".)
            <br>
            Time spent browsing the web is tracked on the X-axis, while the number of words written is tracked on the Y-axis. Time spent offline is indicated by the relative size of each bubble, while time spent on coursework is indicated by three distinct colours representing less than 1 hour (pastel pink), 1 to 4 hours (pastel blue) and more than 4 hours (pastel green).

            <h2>Sketch 2</h2> 
            <p>This sketch now represents the data as a series of points contained within concentric circles.  
            <br>
            All sketches explore the same basic hypothesis: as the amount of time I spend browsing the web increases, the number of words I write per day decreases (as measured using word counts in word processors, online word-counter websites, etc.). In addition, each sketch represents at least one additional variable that may affect the data. In the case of this sketch, time spent on classwork is represented.
            <br>
            Words written per day are denominated exactly in numbers, with no additional visual conversions needed. All other dimensions of data are denoted in hours, with minuted expressed as a decimal percentage (e.g. 12 hours and 30 minutes would be "12.5 hrs".)
            <br>
            The number of words written per day is represented by three concentric circles: the innermost represents less than 150 words written, the middle represents 150-300 words written, and the outermost circle represents more than 300 words written.
            <br>
            Time spent browsing the web is tracked by the relative size of each circle, while the amount of time spent on coursework is represented by colour in the same manner as in Sketch 1.

            <h2>Sketch 3</h2> 
            <p>This sketch is intended to be the "creative" one, representing points of data as notes on sheet music.   
            <br>
            All sketches explore the same basic hypothesis: as the amount of time I spend browsing the web increases, the number of words I write per day decreases (as measured using word counts in word processors, online word-counter websites, etc.). In addition, each sketch represents at least one additional variable that may affect the data. In the case of this sketch, the date of each observation is represented; however, this is intended to be more of an organizational dimension than a proper variable. Additional edits to this idea may be undertaken in order to better represent the data and add in dimensions tracked as variables.
            <br>
            The length of each note represents the number of words written per day, with shorter notes representing lesser values. Data is sorted into five categories represented by sixteenth, eighth, quarter, half and whole notes in ascending order.
            <br>
            Time spent browsing the web is tracked via the pitch of each note as indicated on the sheet music, with middle C (C4) representing the lowest value and tenor high C (C5) representing the highest.
