    <h1 style="text-align:center">Does the amount of time I spend browsing the web affect the number of words I write per day?</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Hypothesis:</b> As the amount of time I spend browsing the web increases, the amount of words I write per day decreases.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align:center">Data was collected once per day for a period of 54 days (from October 10th to December 3rd), using Apple's Screen Time feature in the System Settings application, the word count feature in Microsoft Word, and the website <a href="https://wordcounter.net/character-count.">wordcounter.net</a>. The primary statistics tracked were the number of hours I spent per day browsing the web, and the number of words I wrote per day. Additional statistics tracked included the number of hours I spent on coursework per day and number of hours I spent <i>off</i>line per day. A link to my raw data may be found <a href="./data.json">here</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align:center">Based on the final visualization, it appears that there was fundamentally no correlation between the number of hours spent browsing the web, and the number of words written per day. Since there are values where I spent almost no time browsing the web but wrote few, if any words, and values where I spent a significant amount of time browsing the web while also writing a decent amount of words, I cannot meaningfully conclude that the number of hours per day I spend browsing the web affects the number of words I write per day. Potential avenues for exploration include levels of motivation, the number of assignments I have per week, and whether or not I have an active, externally motivated (i.e. non-personal) writing project to work on. In addition, the data collection process could also be refined as necessary to provide more accurate results.</p>
