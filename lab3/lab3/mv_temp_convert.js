        i honestly had to go back and write the "two if statements" version in after committing this to github because i've already become really used to writing "if-else" in my previous attempts at coding
        in general i prefer "if-else" because IMO it's more elegant and efficient(?) than discrete if-statements
        honestly my general ethos of code is very KISS (keep it simple, silly): 
        whatever is the most lightweight, efficient, streamlined way of doing it that I can come up with, that's how I wanna do it
