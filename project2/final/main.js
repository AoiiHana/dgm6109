    i moved the "return true" declaration to be inside the if-else statement as part of the initial debug process for the else-if part of the statement

    nested if-else wasn't my first choice but again i wanted to try and stick to what was asked for as closely as possible, plus we aren't allowed to use switch just yet anyway. i unfortunately wasn't able to think of a more efficient way to print out the discount
